# Find-My-Food-API

This is a group project made in collaboration by:

- Eleasha Bains
- Bashi Abduwali
- Natalie Bruce

## Project Overview:

The purpose of the find my food app is to create a useful tool to help users monitor calories needed based on their BMI.
Our users are most likely health conscious, finding ways to keep track of their daily intake for a healthy balanced diet.
The app will also suggest meal recommendations based off calorie intake needed, which makes it easier for the user to plan their day.

This app is particularly good for users on the go and users that are looking for a quick fix solution for meal prepping.
